> **Project Description**

Our web version of the popular memory card game where the objective is to collect the most pairs of cards. This version will allow a player to play any of three modes: **easy** (just chose the number of pairs), **timed** (same as easy but with timed countdown) and **challenge** (a progressively difficult game). The player will also be able to log his/her game stats on a leader board using name and country.

> **Sketch of Final Product**

- TBD

> **APIs to be Used**

- `Marvel API` (https://developer.marvel.com/) for the images on the cards.
- `Country flags API` (https://countryflags.io/) for the flags in the leader board.

> **Rough Breakdown of Tasks**

- TBD
